## Introduction

#### Background

An open-source, serverless e-commerce platform delivering ultra-fast, dynamic and personalized shopping experiences.

#### Primary Goal

SureShop natively decouples the presentation layer from your core business and helps you manage any number of storefronts, apps, and devices from a single back-end. You can create beautiful, engaging brand experiences. Bullet-proof your development workflow and content strategy.

End of the era of a specialized, closed-source knowledge and proprietary templates. Just Django, Vue and with power and flexibility of serverless using AWS Lambda. We are working hard to reduce.
